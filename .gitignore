# Apache Tomcat specific (compiled artifacts, logs, server config
usually not versioned)
# These are typically outside your project, but if you have a local
dev server config:
# /webapps/
# /logs/
# /work/
# Database specific (if you have local sensitive config files, exclude
them)
# For example, if you store database credentials in a separate
properties file:
db.properties
database.properties
config.properties
src/main/resources/application.properties # If it contains sensitive
info
src/main/resources/application.yml # If it contains sensitive
